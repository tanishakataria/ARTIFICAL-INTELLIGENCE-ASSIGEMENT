### **Question 1: Turing's Original Paper on AI**

Alan Turing’s 1950 paper, *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*, introduces the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence. He discusses several objections to machine intelligence and refutes them systematically.

#### **Objections that Still Carry Weight**
1. **The Mathematical Objection**: Some argue that Gödel’s incompleteness theorem implies that machines will always have limitations. While AI has advanced significantly, machines still struggle with understanding abstract reasoning and self-reference.
2. **The Argument from Consciousness**: The claim that true intelligence requires subjective experience remains unresolved. Modern AI, despite advancements in deep learning, does not possess consciousness.
3. **The Lady Lovelace Objection**: Lovelace argued that machines can only do what they are programmed to do. Modern machine learning techniques, particularly reinforcement learning, challenge this objection, but the debate on AI creativity remains open.

#### **Validity of Turing’s Refutations**
Turing’s refutations remain largely valid. He argues that intelligence should be judged by behavior rather than internal processes. However, some of his arguments are challenged by modern AI limitations in common sense reasoning and generalization.

#### **New Objections from Recent Developments**
1. **The Ethical Objection**: AI can be biased and unethical, raising concerns about fairness and accountability.
2. **The Interpretability Problem**: Modern AI systems, especially deep learning models, act as black boxes, making their decision-making processes hard to interpret.
3. **The Embodiment Argument**: Intelligence may require physical interaction with the world, which purely computational models lack.

#### **Turing’s 2000 Prediction**
Turing predicted that by 2000, a machine would have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. While chatbots like ELIZA and modern models like ChatGPT can deceive users briefly, true human-level AI has not yet been achieved.

### **Question 2: AI Capabilities in Various Tasks**

1. **Playing a decent game of table tennis** - Partially feasible. Robots like FORPHEUS can play table tennis but lack human adaptability.
2. **Playing a decent game of bridge** - Feasible. AI systems like *GIB* and *WBridge5* perform well in competitive bridge.
3. **Writing an intentionally funny story** - Partially feasible. AI can generate jokes, but humor relies on context and cultural nuances.
4. **Giving competent legal advice** - Feasible in specialized areas. AI like *ROSS Intelligence* can provide legal insights but lacks human reasoning.
5. **Discover and prove a new mathematical theorem** - Feasible. AI systems like *DeepMind’s AlphaTensor* have contributed to theorem proving.
6. **Perform a surgical operation** - Partially feasible. Robots like *da Vinci* assist surgeons but do not operate autonomously.
7. **Unload any dishwasher in any home** - Infeasible. Generalizing across different environments remains a challenge for robotics.
8. **Construct a building** - Partially feasible. AI-driven automation aids construction, but full autonomy is lacking.

### **Question 3: Designing an AI Agent**

#### **Domain: Autonomous Customer Support Chatbot**

**Environment Characteristics:**  
- **Accessible**: The chatbot has access to customer queries and company knowledge bases.
- **Deterministic**: Responses follow predefined algorithms, though learning from interactions adds stochastic elements.
- **Episodic**: Each conversation is independent.
- **Static**: The environment does not change in real-time.
- **Continuous**: Customer interactions occur continuously.

**Agent Architecture:**
A hybrid architecture combining rule-based and machine learning approaches is ideal. Natural Language Processing (NLP) enhances understanding, and reinforcement learning can improve responses over time.

### **Question 4: True or False Assertions**

1. 
   **True.** Rationality depends on complete information, but agents can still optimize based on available data.

2. 
   **True.** In complex environments requiring history-dependent decisions, reflex agents fail.

3. 
   **False.** Some environments are too complex for all agents to be rational.
 
   **False.** The agent program processes inputs, whereas the agent function determines behavior.

5. 
   **False.** Some functions require infinite resources or non-computable solutions.

   **False.** Random actions conflict with optimal decision-making in deterministic environments.

7.
   **True.** If the environments share optimal decision-making criteria, the agent remains rational.
